# TRS80ILCMod Lower Case (8-bit) Adapter Board

This avoids the need to piggy back two 2102 video RAM chips, allowing for their installation side by side over a single socket with connections to the board on 'bit6' and 'd6', found as headers on our replica board. Could be used on an original board if you locate the right pins.

Just needs 2 of 8 pin round pin headers, two DIP16 sockets (unless you're not feeling brave), a 5mm decoupling capacitor e.g. 100nF and two wire connections to bit6 (pin 1) and d6 (pin 2).
